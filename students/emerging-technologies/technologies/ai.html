            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents one of the most transformative technologies of our era. From its theoretical beginnings in the 1950s to today's advanced neural networks and large language models, AI has evolved from a concept in science fiction to a practical tool that powers everything from smartphone assistants to autonomous vehicles.
            </p>
