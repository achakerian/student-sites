            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are transformative technologies that alter how we perceive and interact with digital information. While VR creates fully immersive digital environments that replace the physical world, AR overlays digital content onto the real world, enhancing rather than replacing our reality.
            </p>

            <p>
                From early VR experiments in the 1960s to today's sophisticated headsets and AR applications on smartphones, these technologies have evolved dramatically. The convergence of improved hardware, computer vision, 5G connectivity, and artificial intelligence is finally making the promise of immersive computing a practical reality.
            </p>

            <h3>Mixed Reality (MR)</h3>
            <p>
                Mixed Reality blends the physical and digital worlds, allowing real and virtual objects to interact in real-time. Devices like Microsoft's HoloLens and Magic Leap enable users to manipulate holograms in their physical space, opening new possibilities for design, collaboration, and visualization.
            </p>

                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> High-quality devices remain expensive, limiting widespread adoption.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Acceptance:</strong> Wearing AR/VR devices in public settings faces cultural barriers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Metaverse Vision</h3>
            <p>
                The concept of the metaverse—persistent, shared virtual spaces where users can interact, work, play, and conduct commerce—has captured significant attention and investment. While the full realization of this vision remains years away, AR and VR technologies are fundamental building blocks for these immersive digital worlds.
            </p>

            <h3>Future Outlook</h3>
            <p>
                The next generation of AR/VR technologies promises lighter, more comfortable devices with improved displays and longer battery life. Advances in eye-tracking, hand tracking, and neural interfaces will make interactions more natural. The integration of AI will enable more responsive and intelligent virtual environments.
            </p>

            <p>
                As 5G and edge computing mature, cloud-based rendering will enable photorealistic experiences without heavy local processing. AR glasses are expected to become as common as smartphones, seamlessly blending digital information with our physical world. The line between physical and digital experiences will continue to blur, fundamentally changing how we work, learn, shop, and socialize.
