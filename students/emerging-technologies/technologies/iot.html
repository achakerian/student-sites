            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the vast network of physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity that enables them to collect, exchange, and act on data. From smart home devices to industrial sensors, IoT is creating an interconnected ecosystem where the digital and physical worlds seamlessly interact.
            </p>

            <p>
                The term "Internet of Things" was coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999, but the concept has evolved far beyond its original vision. Today, with billions of connected devices worldwide, IoT is transforming industries, cities, and daily life by enabling real-time monitoring, automation, and data-driven decision-making.
