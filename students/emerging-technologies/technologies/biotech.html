            </p>

            <p>
                Advances in artificial intelligence are accelerating drug discovery and protein design. Synthetic biology is enabling us to create new organisms with specific functions, from bacteria that produce biofuels to engineered cells that detect and treat diseases autonomously.
            </p>

                The convergence of biotechnology with other emerging technologies—AI, nanotechnology, and quantum computing—will unlock capabilities we can barely imagine today. As we gain deeper understanding and control over biological systems, we're entering an era where we can truly design solutions to humanity's greatest challenges, from pandemics to climate change to food scarcity.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, with this power comes responsibility. The biotech community, policymakers, and society must work together to ensure these technologies are developed and deployed ethically, safely, and for the benefit of all humanity.
